## Overview of App
The App is a simple Dashboard to display Data about COVID-19 with Data from [Our World in Data](https://github.com/owid). On the App, you can see how most Countries are doing on a Global View in regards with over 20 COVID-19 related Metrics. Also, you can single-out Countries and compare them to each other.

## Missing Countries
Some Countries are missing because they offer no or clearly wrong Data.
